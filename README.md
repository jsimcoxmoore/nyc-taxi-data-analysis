# NYC Taxi Parquet File Ingestion Script

This Python script automates the ingestion of NYC Taxi Parquet files (yellow, green, and FHV trip data) from the NYC TLC cloud storage into Tinybird using the Events API.

## How It Works

The script:
- Loops through multiple **trip types**: `yellow_tripdata`, `green_tripdata`, `fhv_tripdata`.
- Iterates through multiple **years** (2018 to 2024) and **months** (January to December).
- Constructs the Parquet file URL for each month and trip type.
- Sends the Parquet file URL to the Tinybird Events API for ingestion.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- The `requests` library (install it with `pip install requests`).

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
   cd YOUR-REPO

2.	Ensure that you have the required Python package:

   
   ```bash
      pip install requests
   ```

4.	Run the script:


   ```bash
      python solution.py
```

## Tinybird Configuration

	•	Events API URL: https://api.us-east.aws.tinybird.co/v0/events
	•	Data Source: The data is ingested into the nyc_trip_data data source in Tinybird.
	•	Token: Ensure the token in the script is up-to-date with the correct permissions.

## Script Structure

	•	base_url: The base URL for the Parquet files.
	•	trip_types: The trip types (yellow, green, and fhv).
	•	years: The range of years to ingest data for.
	•	months: The months of the year to ingest data for.

## Assumptions and Questions

	•	Ambiguity in file types: The task requested Parquet files, but we confirmed that both CSV and Parquet formats are available. Parquet format is being prioritized in this script.
	•	Ingestion limits: We assume that Tinybird can handle the ingestion of large datasets via the Events API. If there are performance issues, we might consider batch processing or using another ingestion method.
	•	All files: The instruction mentions “all files,” but it’s unclear if this refers to specific subsets of the dataset or the entirety of the NYC Taxi data. We assume this means all monthly Parquet files for yellow, green, and fhv trips.
	•	Data validation: We assume that the schema will remain consistent across all years and months for the taxi trip datasets, allowing us to process each file similarly.
	•	Error handling: The script currently handles basic error logging, but we assume additional error handling may be needed for large-scale ingestion.
